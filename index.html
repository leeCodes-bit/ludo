        <p class="instructions">1. The game has 2 players playing in rounds <br>
            2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his round score <br>
            3. But if the player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost, after that it's the next player's turn <br>
            4. The player can choose to "hold", which means that his Round score gets added to his Global score. After that it's the 
              next player's turn <br>
            5. The first player to score 100 on Global score wins the game</p>
